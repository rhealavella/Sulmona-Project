            <h2>WHY SULMONA?</h2>
            <h3>Rich history, culture and nature</h3>
            <p>
              Sulmona is a city in the Abruzzo region of Italy, set along the
              long ridge of the Apennine Mountains, which runs nearly the entire
              length of Italy. Sulmona's history predates ancient Rome, and it
              is famous as the birthplace of Ovid, the celebrated Roman poet who
              was exiled during the reign of Emperor Augustus. Today, Sulmona is
              a center for discovering the history, culture, cuisine, and
              stunning natural areas of Abruzzo.
              <br />
              <br />
              With its handful of museums, important churches, excellent
              restaurants, and plenty to see around the perimeter of the city,
              Sulmona is an excellent place to visit for a few days or more,
              particularly for those keen to explore the larger Abruzzo region.

                <h4>Pelino Confetti</h4>
                <p>
                  Sulmona is the birthplace of "confetti", a popular italian
                  candy made of almonds covered in a hard candy shell. These
                  sweet treats are found all over town.

                <h5>Why I love it</h5>
                <p>
                  Pelino confetti are amazing! There are so many flavours to try
                  and seeing how these sweet treats are carefully and
                  thoughtfully made is definitely worth learning about.

                <h4>Farmer's Market</h4>
                <p>
                  Every week in Piazza garibaldi, the town becomes a spectacle
                  as local vendors sell fresh produce and other goods.

                <p>
                  I love a good farmer's market. No matter where I go, a trip to
                  the local market is the best place to find local favourites
                  and enjoy some tasty food. For me, the Sulmona market has to
                  be one of my favourites, and the Porchetta...words cannot
                  describe.
