            <h2>WHY SULMONA?</h2>
            <h3>Rich history, culture and nature</h3>
            <p>
              Sulmona is a city in the Abruzzo region of Italy, set along the
              long ridge of the Apennine Mountains, which runs nearly the entire
              length of Italy. Sulmona's history predates ancient Rome, and it
              is famous as the birthplace of Ovid, the celebrated Roman poet who
              was exiled during the reign of Emperor Augustus. Today, Sulmona is
              a center for discovering the history, culture, cuisine, and
              stunning natural areas of Abruzzo.
              <br />
              <br />
              With its handful of museums, important churches, excellent
              restaurants, and plenty to see around the perimeter of the city,
              Sulmona is an excellent place to visit for a few days or more,
              particularly for those keen to explore the larger Abruzzo region.

              Hi! My name is Rhea and I visited Sulmona a few years back and
              fell in love with this magical city. I created this page as part
              of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding skills.
